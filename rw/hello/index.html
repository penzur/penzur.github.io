          <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>
                And welcome to my hypertext-driven webspace. My name is Elizar,
                and I am a scribe and an occasional conjurer. I speak the language
                of our machine overlords. I also dabble in the incantations of
                the computer gods.

                This domain space will serve as a vault of all the knowledge
                and wisdom that I have acquired over the years. JUST KIDDING! ðŸ˜†
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, actually, for years, I've been meaning to create a blog
                or a portal of some sort in which I'll be able to write or share
                stuff that I'm passionate about. But work-related stuff and sheer
                laziness get me all the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'll try my best to keep this ball rollin'. Wish me luck, you beautiful
                creature!
            </p>

          <h2><span class="mute">/</span>rw</h2>
          <p>
              In the unix/linux system, each file is associated with a bunch of
              permission flags that will determine the access of a certain group
              or individual across the operating system. And the permision flag
              kind of look something like this.
          </p>

          <pre><code>
u   g   o   user   group date        file
rw- --- --- penzur staff May 01 2020 some-file.pdf
          </code></pre>

          <p>
              The first three columns deal with permissions. And under the
              <code>u</code>(user) column, the enabled flags are <code>r</code>(read)
              and <code>w</code>(write) and the last flag is actually <code>x</code>(execute)
              which is disabled in this case.
          </p>

          <p>
              <strong>TL;DR</strong>
              <br>
              I use /rw because it has less characters which means less typing
              and I'm lazy af. ðŸ¤“
